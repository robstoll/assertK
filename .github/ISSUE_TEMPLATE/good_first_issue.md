```
expect(

//instead of

expect(
```

Following the things you need to do:

*domain*
- extend XyAssertions with a function `foo` (see YzAssertions as a guideline)
- modify XyAssertionsBuilder, delegate to xyAssertions (see YzAssertionsBuilder as a guideline)
- delegate implementation to robstoll-lib in XyAssertionsImpl (see YzAssertionsImpl as a guideline)


*lib*
- implement _foo in xyAssertions by using the `ExpectImpl.feature.extractor...`

*api*
- provide a val which returns Expect<T> (see yzAssertions.kt as a guideline)
- provide a fun which expects an `assertionCreator`-lambda and returns Expect<AB> (see yzAssertions.kt as a guideline)
- extend or write a separate Spec named XyFeatureAssertionsSpec in specs-common (see for instance YzFeatureAssertionsSpec) and extend it in atrium-api-fluent-en_GB-common/src/test
