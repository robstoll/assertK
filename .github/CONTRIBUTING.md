## Your First Code Contribution
Fantastic, thanks for your effort! Contact me on 
[slack](https://join.slack.com/atrium-kotlin/shared_invite/MTk4NTkyODg2OTI5LTE0OTc2NDAzOTQtYWYzMTlmNjAxOQ)
whenever you need help to get up and running or create a pull request and 
prepend the title with `[NEED HELP]` and explain your problem in the description.
 
Following a small guidance how I would start.
 
1. Fork the repository to your repositories 
2. Use an IDE which supports Kotlin and gradle projects (I am currently using [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))  
3. Import the projects
4. Read up the [Coding Conventions of Atrium](#coding-conventions)
5. Get to know how [Spek](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/) works or look at 
   the existing specifications in atrium-spec.
6. Write a test-case for an existing class. This way you get familiar with the classes of atrium, 
   you use atrium again and learn how spek works
7. Read the [Pull Request Checklist](#pull-request-checklist) and create your first pull-request.
8. :clap: you have submitted your first code contribution to Atrium :blush:

I would suggest you wait for my feedback so that you get a first impression of what I consider to be important.
Yet, if your fingers almost automatically start to write more code then go on :wink:

## Coding Conventions
So far I do not try to enforce too much. I will review your patches and comment if necessary.
However, here a few hints in order that your pull request is merged quickly.
1. Make sure the compiler does not generate warnings.
2. Try to write code in a similar style as the existing 
   (I suggest you copy something existing and modify it).
3. Write readable code and express comments with code rather than comments.
4. Provide tests in form of [Spek](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/) specifications.
5. Write your commit message in an [imperative style](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).     

## Pull Request Checklist
Make sure you can check every item on the following list before you create a pull request:  
- [ ] your pull request is based on the [latest commit on master](https://github.com/robstoll/atrium/commits/master)
- [ ] your pull request should ideally consists of one small commit. If not then make sure
     - [ ] it cannot be split up in several pull requests
     - [ ] your commits are meaningful to others - e.g. do not include temporary commits like `before lunch`. 
     [Squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing) where appropriate.
     
Once you have created and submitted your pull request, then make sure:
- [ ] your pull request passes travis and all other checks 
     (if not, then improve your pull request and `git push -f`)
