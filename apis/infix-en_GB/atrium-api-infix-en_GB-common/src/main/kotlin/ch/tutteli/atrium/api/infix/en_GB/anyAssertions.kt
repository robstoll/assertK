/**
 * Expects that the subject of the assertion *is a* [TSub] (the same type or a sub-type) and
 * that it holds all assertions the given [assertionCreator] creates.
 *
 * Notice, in contrast to other assertion functions which expect an [assertionCreator], this function returns not
 * [Expect] of the initial type, which was some type `T `, but an [Expect] of the specified type [TSub].
 * This has the side effect that a subsequent call has only assertion functions available which are suited for [TSub].
 * Since [Expect] is invariant it especially means that an assertion function which was not written in a generic way
 * will not be available. Fixing such a function is easy (in most cases),
 * you need to transform it into a generic from. Following an example:
 *
 * ```
 * interface Person
 * class Student: Person
 * fun Expect<Person>.foo()        = "dummy"  // limited only to Person, not recommended
 * fun <T: Person> Expect<T>.bar() = "dummy"  // available to Person and all subtypes, the way to go
 * fun Expect<Student>.baz()       = "dummy"  // specific only for Student, ok since closed class
 *
 * val p: Person = Student()
 * expect(p)               // subject of type Person
 *   .isA<Student> { ... } // subject now refined to Student
 *   .baz()                // available via Student
 *   .foo()                // not available to Student, only to Person, results in compilation error
 *   .bar()                // available via T : Person
 * ```
