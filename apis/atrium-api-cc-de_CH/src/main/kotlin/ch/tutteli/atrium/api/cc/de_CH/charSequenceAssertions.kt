/**
 * Makes the assertion that [AssertionPlant.subject] contains [expected]'s [toString] representation

 *
 * It is a shortcut for `enthaelt.zumindest(1).werte(expected, *otherExpected)`.
 *
 * Notice that a runtime check applies which assures that only [CharSequence], [Number] and [Char] are passed (this
 * function expects `Any` for your convenience, so that you can mix [String] and [Int] for instance).
 *
 * By non disjoint is meant that `'aa'` in `'aaaa'` is found three times and not only two times.
 * Also notice, that it does not search for unique matches. Meaning, if the input of the search is `'a'` and [expected]
 * is defined as `'a'` and one [otherExpected] is defined as `'a'` as well, then both match, even though they match the
 * same sequence in the input of the search. Use the property `enthaelt` to create a more sophisticated `contains`
 * assertion where you can use options such as [zumindest], [hoechstens] and [genau] to control the number of
 * occurrences you expect.
 *
 * Meaning you might want to use:
 *   `enthaelt.genau(2).wert('a')`
 * instead of:
 *   `enthaelt('a', 'a')`
