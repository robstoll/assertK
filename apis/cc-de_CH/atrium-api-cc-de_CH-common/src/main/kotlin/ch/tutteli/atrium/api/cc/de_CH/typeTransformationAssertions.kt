/**
 * Makes the assertion that the [Assert.subject][SubjectProvider.subject] *is a* [TSub] (the same type or a sub-type) and if so,
 * uses [assertionCreator] which could create further assertions which are added as a group.
 *
 * Notice, that asserting a function type is [flawed](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-27846).
 * The actual types are ignored as function types erase to Function0,
 * Function1 etc. on byte code level, which means the assertion holds as long as the [Assert.subject][SubjectProvider.subject] is a
 * function and has the same amount of arguments regardless if the types differ. For instance
 * `esGilt({x: Int -> "hello"}).istEin<String -> Unit>{}` holds, even though `(Int) -> String` is clearly not
 * a `(String) -> Unit`.
 *
 * More generally speaking, the [flaw](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-27826) applies to all generic types.
 * For instance `isA<List<String>>` would only check if the [Assert.subject][SubjectProvider.subject] is a `List` without checking if
 * the element type is actually `String`. Or in other words
 * `esGilt(listOf(1, 2)).isA<List<String>>{}` holds, even though `List<Int>` is clearly not a `List<String>`.
 *
 * @return Notice, that this assertion function cannot provide a fluent API because it depends on whether the first
 *   assertion ([Assert.subject][SubjectProvider.subject] *is a* [TSub]) holds or not. Define subsequent assertions
 *   via the [assertionCreator] lambda.
 *
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
