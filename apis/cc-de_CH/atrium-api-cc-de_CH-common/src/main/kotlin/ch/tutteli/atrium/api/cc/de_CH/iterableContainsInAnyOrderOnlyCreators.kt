 *
 * Notice, that a first-wins strategy applies which means your assertion creator lambdas -- which kind of serve as
 * identification lambdas -- should be ordered in such a way that the most specific identification lambda appears
 * first, not that a less specific lambda wins. For instance, given a `setOf(1, 2)` you should not search for
 * `eintraege({ isGreaterThan(0) }, { toBe(1) })` but for
 * `eintraege({ toBe(1) }, { isGreaterThan(0) })` otherwise
 * `isGreaterThan(0)` matches `1` before `toBe(1)` would match it. As a consequence `toBe(1)` could only match the
 * entry which is left -- in this case `2` -- and of course this would fail.
 *
 * @param assertionCreatorOrNull The identification lambda which creates the assertions which the entry we are looking for
 *   has to hold; or in other words, the function which defines whether an entry is the one we are looking for
 *   or not. In case it is defined as `null`, then an entry is identified if it is `null` as well.
 * @param otherAssertionCreatorsOrNulls Additional identification lambdas which each identify (separately) an entry
 *   which we are looking for (see [assertionCreatorOrNull] for more information).
 *
 * @return The [AssertionPlant] for which the assertion was built to support a fluent API.
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
