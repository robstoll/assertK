 * Kind of a shortcut for `this.key.ist(key).und.value.ist(value)` but should be evaluated in
 * an assertion group block -- which has the effect that the assertion about the value is still evaluated even
 * if the assertion about the key fails. Moreover, it might be that reporting differs compared to using the long form.
 *
 * @return This plant to support a fluent API.
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
