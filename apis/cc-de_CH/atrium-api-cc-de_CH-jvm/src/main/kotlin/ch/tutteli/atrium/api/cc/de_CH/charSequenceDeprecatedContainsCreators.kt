/**
 * Finishes the specification of the sophisticated `contains` assertion where the [expected]'s
 * [getDefault][Translatable.getDefault] representation as well as the [getDefault][Translatable.getDefault]
 * representations of the [otherExpected] (if given) shall be searched, using a non disjoint search.
 *
 * By non disjoint is meant that `'aa'` in `'aaaa'` is found three times and not only two times.
 * Also notice, that it does not search for unique matches. Meaning, if the input of the search is `'a'` and the
 * default translation of [expected] is defined as `'a'` and one default translation of the
 * [otherExpected] is defined as `'a'` as well, then both match, even though they match the
 * same sequence in the input of the search. Use an option such as [zumindest], [hoechstens] and [genau] to control
 * the number of occurrences you expect.
 *
 * Meaning you might want to use:
 *   `enthaelt.genau(2).standardUebersetzungVon(IS)`
 * instead of:
 *   `enthaelt.zumindest(1).standardUebersetzungVon(IS, IS)`
 *
 * @return The [AssertionPlant] for which the assertion was built to support a fluent API.
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
