 * Makes the assertion that the thrown [Throwable] is of type [TExpected].
 *
 * @return Notice, that this assertion function cannot provide a fluent API because it depends on whether the assertion
 *   (a [Throwable] was thrown and is of type [TExpected]) holds or not.
 * If you want to define subsequent assertions on the down-casted [Throwable], then use the overload which expects a
 * lambda (where you can define subsequent assertions).
 *
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
