 * In detail, It compares the absolute difference between the subject and [expected];
 * as long as it is less than or equal the [tolerance] the assertion holds; otherwise it fails.
 * A more mathematical way of expressing the assertion is the following inequality:
 *
 * | `subject of the assertion` - [expected] | â‰¤ [tolerance]
 *
 * @return An [Expect] for the current subject of the assertion.
 * @throws AssertionError Might throw an [AssertionError] if the assertion made is not correct.
