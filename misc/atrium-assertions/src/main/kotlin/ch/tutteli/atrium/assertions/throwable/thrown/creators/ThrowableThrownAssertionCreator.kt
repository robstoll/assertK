/**
 * Represents a creator of a sophisticated a [Throwable] (of type [TExpected]) was thrown assertion.
 *
 * It uses the given [absentThrowableMessageProvider] in case no [Throwable] was thrown at all and uses a [DownCaster]
 * to perform the down-cast to the desired type [TExpected] (for this it passes on the given [failureHandler] to the
 * [DownCaster])
 *
 * @param TExpected The type of the [Throwable] which we expect was thrown.
 *
 * @constructor Represents a creator of a sophisticated a [Throwable] (of type [TExpected]) was thrown assertion.
 * @param absentThrowableMessageProvider Provides a description for the case no [Throwable] was thrown at all.
 * @param failureHandler A handler which decides how the assertion creator lambda (see [executeActAndCreateAssertion])
 *   is used in reporting.
