# Module atrium

## KDoc of Atrium
Atrium is built up by different modules, each available for different platforms.

The packages shown below contain classes etc. 
of all modules excluding the one of 
_atrium-core-robstoll_, _atrium-core-robstoll-lib_, _atrium-domain-robstoll_ and _atrium-domain-robstoll-lib_.

The following names do not include the platform specific suffixes which are `-common`, `-jvm`, `-js` and `-android`. 

Bundle modules:
- **atrium-fluent-en&#95;GB**  defines to have a dependency on   
  atrium-api-fluent-en&#95;GB, atrium-translations-en&#95;GB, atrium-domain-robstoll and and atrium-core-robstoll
- **atrium-infix-en&#95;GB-robstoll** defines to have a dependency on  
  atrium-api-infix-en&#95;GB, atrium-translations-en&#95;GB, atrium-domain-robstoll and and atrium-core-robstoll
  
API modules:  
- **atrium-api-fluent-en&#95;GB** provides an assertion function API in English where the main 
  focus of this API's design is put on ease of use/compatibility with code completion functionality of an IDE.
  It is a pure fluent API.
  extensions:
  - **atrium-api-fluent-en&#95;GB-kotlin_1_3** provides additional assertion functions for types introduced in Kotlin 1.3 (e.g. for `Result`)
  
- **atrium-api-cc-infix-en&#95;GB** provides an assertion function API in English where the main 
  focus of this API's design is put on ease of use/compatibility with code completion functionality of an IDE.
  It is an infix API. 
  
Domain modules:
- **atrium-domain-api** defines the contracts of the domain of Atrium 
  (contracts for impl-functions and sophisticated assertion builders). 
- **atrium-domain-robstoll** provides the different domain services like 
  [CharSequenceAssertions](./ch.tutteli.atrium.domain.creating/-char-sequence-assertions/index.html)  
  which use the implementations of *atrium-domain-robstoll-lib*
- **atrium-domain-robstoll-lib** [robstoll](https://github.com/robstoll)'s implementation of the domain of Atrium.
- **atrium-domain-builders** contains [AssertImpl](./ch.tutteli.atrium.domain.builders/-assert-impl/index.html),
  the [ReporterBuilder](./ch.tutteli.atrium.domain.builders.reporting/-reporter-builder/index.html)
  and last but not least provides base classes of sophisticated assertion builders for the API modules.

Core modules:
- **atrium-core-api** defines the contracts of the core of Atrium.

- **atrium-core-robstoll** provides an implementation for 
  [CoreFactory](./ch.tutteli.atrium.core/-core-factory/index.html) which uses the implementations 
  of *atrium-core-robstoll-lib*
- **atrium-core-robstoll-lib** [robstoll](https://github.com/robstoll)'s implementation of the core of Atrium.

Translation modules:
- **atrium-translations-de&#95;CH** provides translations in German for 
  [Translatable](./ch.tutteli.atrium.reporting.translating/-translatable/index.html)s used in assertion functions. 
- **atrium-translations-en&#95;GB** provides translations in English for 
  [Translatable](./ch.tutteli.atrium.reporting.translating/-translatable/index.html)s used in assertion functions. 

Misc modules:
- **atrium-spec** contains [Spek](https://spekframework.org/) specifications for interfaces (defined in 
  _atrium-core-api_) and assertion functions. The specifications can be reused by implementation of the core of Atrium 
  as well as by API implementations to assure they fulfill the specifications.  
- **atrium-verbs** contains out of the box assertion verbs 
- **atrium-verbs-internal** contains the assertion verbs Atrium uses internally - use with care, 
  no backward compatibility guarantees.

Atrium has currently several modules to retain backward compatibility. 
You should not rely on them and move to the suggested predecessor:
- **atrium-cc-de&#95;CH-robstoll** use `atrium-fluent-de_CH` instead. This bundle defines to have a dependency on
